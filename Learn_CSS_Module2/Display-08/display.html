            1. It covers all the available space

            2. It does'nt have width and height because its a line

            Advantage:
            1. It only covers the requires area

            Disadvantages:
            1. we cannot define it's width and height in inline element

        <!-- inline-block

            Advantage:
            1. We must have an option to define widht and height
            2. The element should not take un-necessary space.

            Block level Element: block level elements are those elements which have
                                 which have height and width. These elements are generally in the format of box.
                                 Block level element covers the complete element box when we apply background-color.
                                 Block level elements always starts from new line because the element prior to it occupy all areas

                                 we can use, display property to change the type from block to 
                                 inline, like- display: inline; we can't modify the heigth and width after we have use this property
