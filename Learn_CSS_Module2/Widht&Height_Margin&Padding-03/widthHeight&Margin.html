        width attribute within the style tag of html helps us to manipulate the width of the tags used in the body
        heigth attribute within the style tag of html helps us to manipulate the height of the tags used in the body
        Point to note: by default the widht and height is set to 100% of the webpage

        box is the shape and size of any given element of the html page
        and height and width just manipulates those attribute of the element, and we use background-color because it helps 
        in view the box
        
        whenever we use a tag it's not just the text shown, but also the box in which we can see the text inside of it


        div tag is nothing in itself untill and unless we assign a value to it.

        margin: margin is basically gap between any two given tags 
                elements by default has there own margins, but we definetely can give margin of our own.
                
                margin has its own values - [margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, margin-left] this attributes
                as the name suggest give margin to it specify value/sides 
                when we want to give the margins in the same tag and line than we use shorthand notation, like- margin: 60px, this
                will give all the side a margin of 60px.
                    we generally use shorthand notation to simplify our code 
                    we have few ways to write shorthand notation for margin-:
                        1: top right bottom left, ex:- margin: 60px 50px 80px 90px;
                        2: top left&right bottom, ex:- margin: 50px 10px 120px;
                        3: top&bottom  left&right, ex:- margin: 80px 20px;  
                        4: top&right&bottom&left, ex:- margin: 100px;
