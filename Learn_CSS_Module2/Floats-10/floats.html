        Floats: when ever we use float in an element that attribute in css leaves the space next to it vacant, because of which next element goes to its 
        previous space. 

        note: if the previous element and next element is a block level element than, if we apply float the next element goes below the previous element. 
              But this situation does not occur when the either of this two next or prev element is inline level element
