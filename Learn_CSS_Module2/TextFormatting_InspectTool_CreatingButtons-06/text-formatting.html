            <!-- 
                color: color property is used to change the text color.  
                       Ex- color: coral;

                font-family: font-family property is used to change the font of the text as we decide.
                             Ex- font-family: Segoe Print;
                
                font-weight: font-weight property is used to give the boldness to the text.
                                we also have sub property of font-weight, like: bold, and bolder(this only works if the font that we have applied already has bolder catergory for fonts), lighter
                                    lighter basically uses the value in between 100 and 900 to make the text thinner
                            Ex- font-weight: lighter;

                text-align: to align the text in the website, by default it has been set to left. sub properties are 
                            {
                                left, right, center,and justify (this adjust the text in a line/ proper order)
                            } 
                            Ex: text-align: center;

                text-transform: this transform the format of text, like uppercase and lowercase etc.
                                {    
                                    uppercase, lowercase, capitalize (capitlize the first letter into capital letter of all text)
                                }
                                Ex: text-transform: capitalize; 

                text-decoration: Its decorates the text element within the webpage,like: underline, line-through, 
                                 none(this is best one, because anchor tag by default has a underline and this can be use to remove it. )
                                 Ex: text-decoration: line-through;

                text-indent: this is used to give the paragraph idea to the text, means it leaves few space at first. Ex: text-indent: 80px;
                             we can also give it negative value, text-indent: -20px;

                letter-spacing: as the name suggest this helps in giving spaces between the letters. this also has negative value like, Ex- letter-spacing: -2px;

                line-height: it creates space between two diffrent lines

                direction: rtl(right to left) and ltr(left to right)  

                word-spacing: it creates space in between two words
             -->

             <!-- 
                inspection-tool: It is a chrome in-built tool use to solve problems. It saves a lot of times and make our coding process effecient
                                 this also helps in finding our error within our code. It also creates its own box model of the elements and tags.
                                 this is basically for testing our code. We can basically do x-ray of any website 😁
